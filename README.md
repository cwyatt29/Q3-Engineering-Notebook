# ENGINEERING Q3 NOTEBOOK

### this note book documents the work that was completed for the third quarter of the 22-23 school year. Most of the Quarter was spent doing CAD practice to prepare for the OnShape exam. The end of the quarter was spent doing code that relates to PID concepts.

## Credits
### Code help from @pweder69 on Github 


## Projects:

### OCE = OnShape Certification, Exam OCP= OnShape Certification Prep

## 1. OCP Single Part
 
### AKA "The Hanger" this was a very simple part to make. I learned how to use the hole tool to counterbore spots for screw heads. I also used three point arcs and relied on constraints instead of dimensions.

## 2. OCP Multipart Studio

### The Multipart practice assignment was more chalenging because we had to make three different parts work together. Similar to the cylinder the Mic stand had to be built in order often using other parts to determine the dimensions of other parts. Replicated the provided design using the images provided whilst not relying on only dimensions. I heavily used tools like equal, parallel, and symmetric. I also used the section veiw tool which essentially let you see the part if it was cut in half. This is useful for making sure all of your parts are in the correct place. It is also good to occcacsionly use the check interfernce tool to make sure nothing is to big.

## 3. OCP Assemblies

### The Assemblies assignment was to assemble a pair of vice grips from parts that were provided. During this assignment I learned more about mates. I used parallel, fastened, revolute, and slider mates. This assignment helped me prepare of the OCE because it taught me how to mate and measure parts.

## 4. OCP THE SWING ARM

### This was the same part that we made in Q1. We did this to see if our knowledge had grown after completing the practice.

### Replicated the provided design using the images provided whilst not relying on only dimensions. I heavily used tools like equal, parallel, and symmetric. There is only one part in the assignment but the part is very complex and has holes, filets and, chamfers on every single plane.

## Reflection

### The original image was black and white so it was hard to see what the final should look like. Also it was really easy to try to use dimensions on everything but it will save you so much time if you use constrains that change as needed but will also keep the structure of the shape better.

## 6. Temperature Sensor

## 7. Rotary Encoder
