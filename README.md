# ENGINEERING Q3 NOTEBOOK

### this note book documents the work that was completed for the third quarter of the 22-23 school year. Most of the Quarter was spent doing CAD practice to prepare for the OnShape exam. The end of the quarter was spent doing code that relates to PID concepts.

## Credits
### Code help from @pweder69 on Github 


## Projects:

### OCE = OnShape Certification, Exam OCP= OnShape Certification Prep

## 1. OCP Single Part
 
### AKA "The Hanger" this was a very simple part to make. I learned how to use the hole tool to counterbore spots for screw heads. I also used three point arcs and relied on constraints instead of dimensions.




## 2. OCP Multipart Studio

### The Multipart practice assignment was more chalenging because we had to make three different parts work together. Similar to the cylinder the Mic stand had to be built in order often using other parts to determine the dimensions of other parts. 


## 3. OCP Assemblies

### The Assemblies assignment was to assemble a pair of vice grips from parts that were provided. During this assignment I learned more about mates. I used parallel, fastened, revolute, and slider mates. This assignment helped me prepare of the OCE because it taught me how to mate and measure parts.


## 4. OCP General Knowledge

## 5. OCP THE SWING ARM

## 6. Temperature Sensor

## 7. Rotary Encoder
